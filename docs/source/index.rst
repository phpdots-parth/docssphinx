Why EMFI
----------

EMFI came into being in response to a market that is highly fragmented with divergent needs of onshore and offshore investors going unaddressed.

Traditional banks and financial companies are heavily focused on certain segments and products or services that fit into their top down business structures.

EMFI aims to bridge those gaps by taking a bottom up approach to identify fragments and provide customized and tailored solutions to address those needs.



Onshore Investors
-----------------------

We deliver up-to-date market colour from major financial centers of the world to local investors who might operate in a very different context.

We provide our expertise and analysis to less sophisticated onshore clients who might be ignored by traditional players due to their size.

Through our business partners, we provide direct market access to a 100 markets in 25 developed and emerging countries.
